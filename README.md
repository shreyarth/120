## 120----FINAL PROJECT

## Description:
This is a repository for the final project for 120 classes. The game is using phaser framework and written in javascript.

## Synopsis: 
The game's protagonist needs to take a shit due to eating bad food. He goes from places to places finding bathroom to relieve himself.
But beware! The player needs to keep a balance of pressure via a visible poop-o-meter. If you hold too long, you'll poop your pants. If
you use too much, your internals will explode. This is a mish-mash of frustration and hilarity.
